This library was developed as an education project for learning how to 
implement more advanced C++ patterns as used e.g. by the boost (and in the meanwhile tr1) 
libary. That's why you can find interfaces directly compatible with boost classes.


These are:

 * generic functors and binders
 * tribool
 * calltraits
 * typetraits
 * signals and slots
 * tuple
 * if_
 * typelists and appropriate algorithms


The more sophisticated library parts built on-top of these intrinsics are:

 * generative commandline parser framework
 * generative inifile parser framework
 * generative service-oriented IPC library introducing a C++ embedded DSL for defining service 
   interfaces

So you can use all these generative frameworks without installing boost on your computer 
(which may be a problem for some people working in companies that do explicitly not allow
the use of boost libraries).


Where is the source?

Most of the code is header-only. Some functions should be implemented in C++ source files
but for simplicity reasons when developing prototypes I have never split the code.


Compilers:

Well, I only developed on GCC >4.4. Due to the extreme usage of templating techniques
I will not guarantee that any of the code will work with other compilers (especially VS compiler).


Status:

Most of the source is rapid prototyping. It may work or it may not. Feel free to make a 
real good project from any of the parts.


CopyLeft:

Feel free to do with the code whatever you want. It's free open-source code.

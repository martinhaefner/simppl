ThreadingModel as a Policy
==========================

 * SingleThreaded (as-is)
 * MultiThreaded (thread-pool)
   * server side
   * client side

   server side: requests are handled within a thread pool, the sockets are handled by the main thread, but
   all request handlers are called within the pool. Therefore, the requests are queued and the threads will
   take the requests in a FIFO order. For response dispatch we need a way back to the dispatcher since in 
   this case the thread may _never_ send anything blocking on any socket (in order to avoid event scattering
   on the wire).

   poll loop -------------> queue <------------- thread 1
               (request)      ^ ^
                              | +--------------- thread 2
                              +------------------thread 3

   thread x --------------> back-queue <----------- poll loop
              (response)                  

   The Stubs (-> Policy) thereby may be 
 
    * reentrant 
      -> we have nothing to be concerned about (just catch the event from the queue)

    * non-reentrant 
      -> the same server may not be called twice if it is already active in a thread
         * need activity flag
         * events may only be extracted from the queue if the corresponding stub is ready


Add further interaction device to event-loop
============================================

Add a generic fd based device to the dispatcher interface. This would be much easier if I base the whole
thing on top of the async IO framework.

Then, we can add further endpoints to the dispatcher to allow to handle also tcp based requests.


Transport error detection
=========================

Still missing. No concept yet.

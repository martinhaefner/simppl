Generic service oriented IPC libary framework for generating skeleton and stub code 
from a high-level interface description directly in C++ by the C++ compiler so 
there is no need for external code generator tools necessary.


Features
========

Interface level

 * shoot-and-forget requests
 * requests with associated responses or error responses
 * signals 
 * attributes with appropriate notifications (value changes, always, user-requested)  
 * event driven interface
 * blocking (RPC) call interface
 

Transport level

 * Unix domain socket transport
 * TCP/IP transport
 * service broker for automatic service resolution


Possible future features

 * UDP/datagram transport for signals and shoot-and-forget requests
 * multithread support 
   * send requests from other threads
   * receive events in thread-pool
